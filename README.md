# VirtualEnvironment

Collaborators: Kexin Han, Xinyang Gao and Vishnu Anirudh (myself).

This project is implemented in CAVE technology. This is done as part of COMPGV07 - Virtual Environments in University College London. This project is implemented using Unity game engine and MiddleVR license.

This project implements "Escape-the-room" scene. The concept chosen for this project is, the user needs to escape out of a room due to an earthquake. However, the some wires in the room get snapped and the room catches fire from one of the live wire catches, and as a result, the electricity goes out. Thus, the user needs to first the fire extinguisher with the help of his torch light (in his iphone) and put out the fire using the oystick. After the fire is put out, the user needs to find the emergency button in the dark room surrounded by debris. After the electricity is switched on, the user needs to break open the automatic door.

All the assets are not provided in this repository (if required, this author can be contacted). However, the code for various tasks such as using torch light, recreating camera shake in the scene, animating the power switch and so on are given.
